APPLICATION SCREENS

For a quick overview of my project, I recommend reviewing the screenshots in the Application screens folder

NOTES

We have to download the project first and use Visual Stusdio. For the site to work, you need to type update-database in the Package Manager Console. The command will create a local database. Database seeding is performed during the first run of the program (https profile) in the BookstoreSeeder file.

DESCRIPTION

A website design made in ASP.NET MVC. The site allows browsing books, audiobooks, songs, movies etc. We can add selected items to the shopping cart and the shopping cart tab will add selected items. We can remove items from the shopping cart. CRUD functions were used for each media type. Operations can be performed on the displayed views.

User authentication was applied using the AspNetCore.Identity package. The application allows users to register and then log in for each user. The logged-in user has a shopping 'Basket' cart personalized for them, in which media are saved when they are added to the basket.

The Contact tab displays my resume in PDF format, and has an email sending function. All you need to do is enter the recipient's email, title and content of the email. The SMTP protocol and the System.Net.Mail library are used to send emails.
